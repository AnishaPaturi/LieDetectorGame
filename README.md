# LieDetectorGame
This app analyzes facial micro-expressions and voice tone to estimate deception in videos or live chats. Using Firebase, OpenFace/MediaPipe, and OpenAI Whisper, it generates a “truth score” via a custom ML model. Features include video uploads, a lie-game with training overlay, and live friend-vs-friend mode.
